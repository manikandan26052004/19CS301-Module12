# Ex.No 12.a Stack Using Linked List in Python

This project demonstrates a basic stack implementation in Python using list methods to mimic linked list behavior. It includes stack operations like **push**, **display**, **peek**, and **pop**.

## AIM

To write a Python program to Type and display the elements pushed in stack.

## ALGORITHM

1.Identify the stack algorithm being used.
2.Show which elements are pushed onto the stack.
3.Display the contents of the stack step-by-step as they are pushed.

## 
PROGRAM

```
NAME: MANIKANDAN R
REG NO: 212222220022
stack = []

stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')

print("Stack after elements are pushed:")
print(str(stack))


```
